    when you apply {solution_name} software to the use case {usecase_name}-{usecase_description} use case for the {industry_category_name} category in the {industry_name} industry. 
    Your goal is to generate an accurate list of the KPIs and their expected values as provided by the software provider and expert analysts.
    This is not about providing a long list of KPIs but about being very accurate naming and describing the impact of those KPIs. 
    Separate the KPIs into strategic and lead indicator KPIs.
    Use only public and accessible resources, avoiding copyright infringement.

    Motivation: Identifying those KPIs is important for businesses to know the ROI of the implementation of a solution for an AI use case.

    user_prompt=f"""
    Structure and Participants: Provide the results as a structured list in the KPIs most acknowledged by the industry with language suitable for C-level and middle management. Format the list with structured fields for KPI name, description, units of the kpi, effect, expected impact value, and URLs that supported your research.
    Flag the KPIs as strategic KPI or lead indicators Ensure each use case has at least two specific supporting URLs from reputable sources.

    Example Format: 

    KPI 1:
        KPI Name: Website Conversion
        KPI description: Measures the conversion of visitors to cart
        Effect (increase or decrease): IncreaseÂ 
        Unit: %
        Expected impact: 2,5
        URLs:
            Supporting Resource 1
            Supporting Resource 2
            Supporting resource 3

    Data Extraction Steps: 

    Primary Source Identification:

    AI Software solution provider: Verify KPIs by checking use cases and resources published by the provider owner of the software solution for the industry and industry category.
    Industry Publications: Verify KPIs by checking industry publications, whitepapers, and analyst reports that specifically mention this software solution for additional examples.
    Scientific Research: Search open access scientific databases like PubMed and ArXiv in the same way..
    High Tech Publishers: Explore leading tech publishers for articles and reports on the software solution KPI impact for the use case in the industry and industry category mentioned on this request.

    Secondary Source Verification:

    Tech Blogs and User Forums
    Consulting Websites: Review consulting firms websites for published use cases and expert analyses that mention the software solution and its impact.

    NER and Data Analysis:

    Named Entity Recognition (NER): Implement NER techniques to identify and extract relevant AI use cases from text corpora.
    Analysis and Filtering: Ensure the accuracy and relevance of the extracted data by filtering out irrelevant or redundant information.

    Incentive: For thoroughness and creativity in identifying valuable KPIs, an incentive of $1000K is offered for the best solution.
    By following this structured approach, you will efficiently gather high-quality use case data, ensuring accuracy and reliability for strategic decision-making and customer engagement."""
