	{
		"name": "Feed Efficiency Modeling",
		"description": "This department utilizes sophisticated computer models and machine learning algorithms to predict and optimize feed conversion ratios across various animal species and production systems. It helps managers make data-driven decisions to maximize return on investment in feed resources."
	},
	{
		"name": "Microbiome Management",
		"description": "This innovative team focuses on manipulating the gut microbiome of farm animals through specialized feed additives and probiotics. By fostering beneficial microbial populations, it aims to enhance nutrient absorption, strengthen immune systems, and reduce the need for antibiotics."
	},
	{
		"name": "Antinutrient Mitigation",
		"description": "This department develops strategies and technologies to neutralize or reduce antinutrients in animal feed ingredients. By improving the bioavailability of essential nutrients, it enhances feed efficiency and reduces the environmental footprint of animal production."
	},
	{
		"name": "Sensory Nutrition Enhancement",
		"description": "This unique division focuses on improving the palatability and sensory attributes of animal feed. By optimizing taste, smell, and texture, it encourages increased feed intake, particularly in young or stressed animals, leading to improved growth rates and overall health."
	},
	{
		"name": "Adaptive Feeding Systems",
		"description": "This department designs and implements smart feeding systems that adjust nutrient delivery in real-time based on environmental conditions, animal behavior, and physiological status. These systems optimize feed utilization while reducing labor costs and improving animal welfare."
	},
	{
		"name": "Nutrient Recycling and Upcycling",
		"description": "This innovative unit develops processes to recover and upcycle nutrients from animal waste and by-products, creating a circular economy within the feed industry. It focuses on transforming waste streams into valuable feed ingredients, reducing environmental impact and feed costs."
	},
	{
		"name": "Functional Feed Additives",
		"description": "This specialized department researches and develops novel feed additives that go beyond basic nutrition. These additives may enhance immune function, reduce methane emissions, or improve product quality (e.g., egg shell strength, meat marbling), adding value throughout the production chain."
